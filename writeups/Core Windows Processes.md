These are legitimate processes that run every time Windows boots. Some have parent-child relationships, which matter during threat hunting.

    â”œâ”€â”€ csrss.exe  
    â”œâ”€â”€ wininit.exe  
        â”œâ”€â”€ services.exe  
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ svchost.exe  
    â”œâ”€â”€ lsass.exe  
    â””â”€â”€ winlogon.exe  
        â””â”€â”€ explorer.exe
      
Notes:
System should only have PID 4 and parent System Idle Process (0).

wininit.exe, services.exe, and svchost.exe follow a strict parent-child chain.

If svchost.exe is running but wasnâ€™t started by services.exe, ðŸš¨ that's suspicious.
